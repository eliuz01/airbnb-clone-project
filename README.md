# airbnb-clone-project
Airbnb Clone - Backend
Overview
This project implements the backend of an Airbnb-like platform, designed to manage users, property listings, bookings, payments, and reviews. It provides a scalable, secure, and well-documented RESTful and GraphQL API for seamless interaction with frontend clients.

Objectives
Build a reliable backend that mimics the core functionalities of Airbnb.

Ensure scalability, maintainability, and security across all components.

Provide comprehensive API documentation for easy integration and testing.

Key Features
User Management: Register, authenticate, and manage user profiles.

Property Management: Create, update, and retrieve property listings.

Booking System: Reserve properties, manage booking lifecycle, and handle availability.

Payment Processing: Process and track transactions.

Review System: Enable users to leave reviews and ratings for listed properties.

Performance Optimization: Includes database indexing and caching for faster response times.

"Team Roles"
The development of this Airbnb Clone backend involves multiple roles, each critical to the project‚Äôs success. Below is an overview of each role and their key responsibilities:
### üßë‚Äçüíª Backend Developer
**Responsibility**:
Designs and implements the core backend logic and APIs. This includes creating RESTful and GraphQL endpoints, managing business logic, ensuring security (e.g., authentication and authorization), and integrating third-party services like payment gateways.
### üóÉÔ∏è Database Administrator (DBA)
**Responsibility**:
Designs and maintains the database schema, ensuring data integrity, performance, and scalability. Handles indexing, query optimization, and backup/recovery strategies to support a responsive and reliable system.
### ‚öôÔ∏è DevOps Engineer
**Responsibility**:
Automates the deployment process using CI/CD pipelines, manages Docker containerization, monitors application performance, and ensures system reliability and scalability across development and production environments.
### üß™ QA Engineer
**Responsibility**:
Conducts manual and automated testing to identify bugs and ensure feature functionality. Defines test cases, performs regression testing, and verifies that APIs meet business and technical requirements.
### üß† Project Manager *(optional but commonly included)*
**Responsibility**:
Coordinates the team, manages timelines, and ensures milestones are met. Acts as the communication bridge between technical teams and stakeholders, prioritizing tasks and maintaining project scope.

"Technology Stack"
Django - A high-level Python web framework used to build secure and maintainable backend applications. Handles routing, models, and admin interfaces.
Django REST Framework - An extension of Django for building RESTful APIs. Facilitates serialization, authentication, and permissions.
PostgreSQL - A powerful, open-source relational database system used for storing structured data such as users, properties, and bookings.
GraphQL - A query language for APIs that enables flexible and efficient data retrieval by allowing clients to specify exactly what data they need.
Celery - An asynchronous task queue used for background jobs like sending emails, processing payments, and notifications.
Redis - An in-memory data store used for caching, session storage, and as a Celery message broker to enhance performance.
Docker - A containerization platform that ensures consistency across development, testing, and production environments.
CI/CD Pipelines - Automates testing, integration, and deployment processes to improve code quality and accelerate delivery.
